Hi! Guys.

This is a bot for telegram with Cohere AI.

Before you run the 'main.py', please make sure you've created '.env' file where store all of your token, API key and Bot username.

.env

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
COHERE_API_KEY = YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY
BOT_USERNAME = YOUR_BOT_USERNAME

And also make sure you've installed all packages. RUN this in console.

pip install -r requirements.txt

THANK YOU!
